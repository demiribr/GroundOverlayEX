Defines javascript classes:  GroundOverlayEx, GroundOverlayEX_mgr, LatLngQuad
Classes are extended from google.maps.MVCObject (GroundOverlayEX_mgr, LatLngQuad), 
        and google.maps.OverlayView (GroundOverlayEx)
Libraries needed:  Google Maps API, Numeric.js, 
Libraries included:  Earth API library for Maps v3 (plus adaptions)

Concepts of Operation:
1.  The GroundOverlayEX class can be used "stand-alone" alongside other Google Maps features, including 
    regular GroundOverlay objects.  A minimal set of constructor information to a GroundOverlayEX object will 
    display the image like any other GroundOverlay, but also providing cropping, rotation, and/or non-rectangular 
    transforms that the regular GroundOverlay class cannot provide.
2.  To gain functionality more like Google Earth, numerous GroundOverlayEx objects can be instanciated and placed
    under the management of a GroundOverlayEX_mgr object.  The manager will dynamically display or not display
    images from the GOEXs it manages based upon the current map viewport latitudes and longitudes.  Thus hundreds
    or thousands of GOEXs could be defined and loaded into the manager, but the map and the browser will only need to
    handle a limited number of images that should be presently showing given the map position and zoom.  The manager
    is particular needed for handling a huge quantities of GOEXs, or for handling a large quantity of very large 
    high-resolution images.  When under management, the GOEXs that are actively displaying are participating in 
    the Google Maps environment.
    
    
Data types used:  all the google.maps data types (e.g. LatLng, LatLngBounds); a LatLngQuad data type as been added:

object = new LatLngQuad(bottomRight_LatLng, bottomLeft_LatLng, topRight_LatLng, topLeft_LatLng)
LatLng = .getBottomLeft();
LatLng = .getBottomRight();
LatLng = .getTopRight();
LatLng = .getTopLeft();
